# NGS-data

## Introduciton

This is Novogene's depository where any kinds of sequencing data are stored at. Any researchers, clinicians or collaborators who are interested in NGS can download freely. And we appriciate that you could give us any advice or suggestions.

## 1. Human Genome Sequencing

To compare with benchmark of GIAB, we provide genome sequencing data of HG002, which is one member of Ashkenazim son-father-mother trio, also named NA24385. The "High-confidence" variant calls are available for GRCh37 and GRCh38 under each genome at [NCBI ftp](https://bit.ly/2HNGELT)
(ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/release/).
